    'The world has changed a lot in the last few decades. Sure, if you look out the window you won\'t see flying cars or cyberpunk skyscrapers, but that\'s not the type of changes I\'m talking about.'

    'Forty years ago, a genetically distinct subspecies of human called "futa" emerged. No one is sure where they came from — genetic engineering, divine intervention, or a millenia-old secret society revealing itself — but they have a biochemical...quirk.'

    'When a male absorbs their cum, he becomes physiologically addicted. The more he\'s exposed, the more he needs it. This cum diet causes euphoria, emotional dependence, and some mental...handicapping. Males in this state are called "bound".'

    'Futa now represent a significant portion of the human race. Needless to say, this has changed things. Education, religion, laws and politics are all shifted to suit them.'

    'In short order, they founded their own nation — the Futanari Empire. Naturally, I live in it.'

    'The Male Rights Enforcement Agency (or MREA) are the theocratic police of the Empire. They keep law and order...and also enforce male submission. Bad males get sent to the Pens, for \'reeducation\'.'

    'Culture has diverged. Futa are given the best education available, with a focus on science and international diplomacy. In contrast, most males only get hands-on sexual education. Some of us hardly know how to count to ten, or write our names...'

    'Some males fight back. Within the Empire, a group of rebels, the \'Male Independence Faction\', fights to keep futa from taking too much power. It...isn\'t safe to associate with them, not unless you want to get disappeared.'

    'I\'ve managed to keep my distance from futa so far, and I\'m planning to keep my head down for as long as possible. I don\'t want to draw attention on myself — defiant males don\'t stay free for long.'

    'So for now, I nurture my dreams. Someday, I\'ll have that white picket fence. I just have to keep focused, and stay ready to handle anything the Empire throws at me——'

    announcer 'Exciting news, Empire citizens! The Male Protection Act is set to be ratified today, with near unanimous parliamentary support. As of tomorrow, any futa who binds a male becomes his legal guardian, and takes ownership of all his possessions!'
